	<location id="hangar">
		<description>The station main hangar is rather unremarkable. The only

			slides next to the floor. It's very faint. Your wrist computer tells
			you this is harmless.

	<location id="pod 2">
		<description>A empty living pod. Looks as if it was never ever used.

	<location id="pod 4">
		<description>A scientists pod, for sure. It's neat, clean and
			organized. Not much around.

	<location id="pod 3">
		<description>A young woman's pod. You do recognize a few items, but

	<location id="main hall 1">
		<description>A well lit hall, with doors. It's the main hub of the

	<location id="main hall 2">
		<description>
			Not as imponent as the main hall from Level1, this hall
			has a busier feel. Here you see objects thrown all over the place,
			as
			if someone was in the middle of a day-to-day routine and had to
			quickly run.
